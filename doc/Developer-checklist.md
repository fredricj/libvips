libvips is a slightly unusual library and you need to consider some features
when you design software that uses it.

## If you can, use `thumbnail`, not `resize`

The `thumbnail` operation combines load and resize into one step. This lets it
take advantage of format library features, such as shrink on load, and can
lead to a large improvement in speed and drop in memory use.

For example, with this JPEG image:

```
$ vipsheader nina.jpg
nina.jpg: 6048x4032 uchar, 3 bands, srgb, jpegload
```

I see:

```
$ /usr/bin/time -f %M:%e vips resize nina.jpg x.jpg 0.1
123648:0.23
```

124 MB of RAM and 0.23s to shink by a factor of 10. With `thumbnail` it's:

```
$ /usr/bin/time -f %M:%e vips thumbnail nina.jpg x.jpg 605
68864:0.08
```

Now it's 68 MB of memory and 0.08s -- half the memory use, and 3x faster. In
fact the improvement is better than that, since the ``vips` command takes a
while to start and needs a fair amount of memory:

```
$ /usr/bin/time -f %M:%e vips > /dev/null
31232:0.02
```

31 MB and 0.02s, so `thumbnail` is really 2.5x less memory and 4x faster.

You can see much larger improvements with other formats, and quality will
often be better as well, since `thumbnail` will automatically premultiply and
will render vector images at the correct size.

## Don't use `thumbnail_image`

It's just there for emergencies. It can't do any of the rendering tricks,
so it's no faster than `resize`. Use `thumbnail` if you can.

## Use sequential mode if you can

This is a hint you pass to `new_from_file` and friends that signals that you
will only scan this image in the direction that the underlying load library
supports. This can give a useful improvement in speed and reduction in memory
use in many cases.

See [the "How it opens files"](How-it-opens-files.html) chapter for background
on this feature.

## Use longer pipelines if you can

libvips is demand-driven, and uses *partial images* as intermediates. This
means you can construct long pipelines of image processing operations,
they won't use much memory, and they'll (usually) join efficiently.

libvips is *horizontally threaded*, meaning that threads run along
the pipeline of operations you are evaluating, not up and down images. This
means that libvips can (usually) parallelise longer pipelines more efficiently
than short ones.

If you can, aim for long pipelines of processing operations.

## Adjust the order of operations in pipelines

If you can, put large resizes right at the start (see `thumbnail` above),
then area filters (sharpen, for example), and finally any point operations.
